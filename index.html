  <h1>This is a first level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into red color</h1>
  <h2>This is a second level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into blue color</h2>
  <h3>This is a third level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into green color</h3>
  <p>This is a <em>paragragh</em> As you can see, I placed an empahisis on the word "paragraph". Now, I will change also
    the background color of the word "paragraph" to black, and its text color  to green, all with just CSS.</p>
  <p>The main essence of this tutorial is to:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>Show you how to format a web document with HTML</li>
       <li>Show you how to design a web page with CSS</li>
       <li>Show you how to program a web document with JavaScript</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Next, I am going to add the following two numbers and display the result, all with JavaScript</p>
  <label>First number:</label> 
  <input type="text" id="num1">
  <label>Second number:</label> 
  <input type="text" id="num2">
  <p style="display: none;">Therefore, the sum of the two of those numbers is: <span id= "sum">(placeholder for the answer)</span></p>
  <p style="display: none;">Therefore, the product of the two of those numbers is: <span id= "product">(placeholder for the answer)</span></p>
  
  <button type="submit" id="sumButton" onclick="displaySum();">Click to add!</button>
  <button type="submit" id="productButton" onclick="displayProduct();">Click to multiply!</button>
